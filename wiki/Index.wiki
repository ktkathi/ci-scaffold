Scaffold library for PHP Code Igniter framework.

[http://ci-scaffold.googlecode.com/files/ci-scaffold-0.1a.tar.gz Alpha version released].

= Introduction =

CI-Scaffold generates files based on a pre-defined template, that can be changed to generate it the way you think better.

= Usage =

You must extract the zip file at system/application/libraries folder and use it as a Code Igniter Library.

You must create a Controller that calls the Scaffold generate method like this:

{{{
<?php

class Generate extends Controller {
    public function __construct(){
        parent::Controller();
    }
    public function index(){
        $this->load->library('scaffold');
        $this->scaffold->generate();
    }
}

}}}

This Controller will list your tables to you select one. Submiting the table will generate scaffold files for this.
